# Determining the Type of Motion to Superimpose Figure ア (A) onto Figure イ (I)

## Step 1: Observing the Shapes of Figure ア (A) and Figure イ (I)

Figure ア (A) and Figure イ (I) are quadrilaterals with similar shapes but different orientations. This initial observation suggests that the two figures may be related through a type of motion that can align them properly.

## Step 2: Analyzing the Possibilities of Motion

There are three types of motion that can be used to move figure ア (A) and superimpose it onto figure イ (I): parallel translation, rotation, and symmetry. Each of these motions will be analyzed to determine if they can successfully align the two figures.

## Step 3: Checking for Parallel Translation

Parallel translation involves moving figure ア (A) parallel to itself without changing its orientation. However, since the orientation of figure ア (A) is different from that of figure イ (I), parallel translation is not a viable option. Translating figure ア (A) parallel to itself will not enable it to superimpose onto figure イ (I).

## Step 4: Checking for Rotation

Rotating figure ア (A) around its center is a possible motion that can align it with figure イ (I). Since the shapes are similar, a rotation can properly align them. By rotating figure ア (A) around its center, it is possible to superimpose it onto figure イ (I).

## Step 5: Checking for Symmetry

Reflecting figure ア (A) through a symmetry axis is another possible motion that can be considered. However, reflecting figure ア (A) will change its orientation, but not align it with figure イ (I). Therefore, symmetry is not a viable option to superimpose figure ア (A) onto figure イ (I).

## Step 6: Conclusion

Based on the analysis of the three types of motion, it is concluded that rotation is the correct answer. By rotating figure ア (A) around its center, it is possible to superimpose it onto figure イ (I). This type of motion aligns the similar shapes properly, enabling them to overlap perfectly.
